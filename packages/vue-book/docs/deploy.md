# Deploy documentation

* Before deploy you have to manually change version in `packages/vue-book/package.json`

* `npm publish --tag latest` to publish to latest (what majority of users will get). 
* `npm publish --tag next` to publish to alpha. Alpha versions look like this: `0.1.0-alpha.18`.
